# Developer Overview

## What is it?
The **Developer Center** is for technical users. It provides tools to integrate WhatsApp with other software like your CRM, Website, or ERP.

## Why is it useful?
- **Integration**: Connect WhatsApp to Salesforce, HubSpot, or a custom database.
- **Automation**: Trigger actions in your app when a message is received (Webhooks).
- **Control**: Manage API keys for secure access.

## Dashboard Stats
- **Active API Tokens**: Number of apps creating connections.
- **Webhook Subscriptions**: Number of event listeners active.
- **Recent Deliveries**: Count of data payloads successfully sent to your server in the last 7 days.

## Use Cases
1.  **Custom CRM**: You want to save every incoming message to your internal SQL database. You use **Webhooks** to send data there.
2.  **App Notification**: You have a mobile app. When a user registers, you use the **API** to send a "Welcome" WhatsApp message automatically.
