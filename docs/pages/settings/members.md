# Team Members

## What is it?
**Team Members** is where you manage staff access. You can invite colleagues to your workspace and assign them specific roles.

## Why is it useful?
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can reply to chats at the same time.
- **Security**: Give "Agent" access to support staff (so they can't change billing) and "Admin" access to managers.
- **Audit**: See who did what (via Activity Log).

## Option Buttons (UI Guide)
- **Invite Member**: Send an email invitation to a new user.
- **Role**:
  - **Admin**: Full access to everything.
  - **Editor**: Can send messages and edit contacts, but cannot change billing or system settings.
- **Remove**: Revoke access immediately.

## Use Cases
1.  **Shift Work**: You hire 3 new support agents. You invite them as "Editor". They can answer chats but cannot accidentally delete your API keys.

## How to Use
1.  **Navigate**: Go to **Settings** > **Members**.
2.  **Invite**: Click **Add Member**.
3.  **Details**: Enter email `agent@company.com` and select Role `Editor`.
4.  **Send**: They will receive an email to join.
