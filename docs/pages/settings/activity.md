# Activity Log

## What is it?
The **Activity Log** is a security audit trail. It records every significant action taken by your team members inside the dashboard.

## Why is it useful?
- **Accountability**: Know exactly who deleted a campaign or exported contacts.
- **Security**: Spot suspicious login activity (via IP address).
- **Compliance**: Maintains a record of system changes for internal audits.

## Option Buttons (UI Guide)
- **Filters**:
  - **User**: See actions by a specific person (e.g., "John Doe").
  - **Action**: See only specific event types (e.g., `campaign.deleted`).
- **Search**: Find logs by description.
- **Table Columns**:
  - **User**: Who did it.
  - **Action**: What they did.
  - **Description**: Details (e.g., "Deleted Campaign ID 55").
  - **IP Address**: Where they logged in from.

## Use Cases
1.  **Mistake Tracking**: A critical template was deleted. You check the log, see "Jane" did it at 2:00 PM, and ask her why.
2.  **Security Audit**: You see a login from a foreign country IP address. You immediately change passwords.

## How to Use
1.  **Navigate**: Go to **Settings** > **Activity Log**.
2.  **Search**: Type "Deleted" to see all deletion events.
