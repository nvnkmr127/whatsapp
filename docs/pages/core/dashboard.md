# Console Overview (Dashboard)

## What is it?
The **Dashboard** (or Console Overview) is the first screen you see when you log in. It acts as a "Mission Control" center, giving you an instant snapshot of your WhatsApp business health. It summarizes key metrics, provides one-click access to common tasks, and visualizes message traffic trends.

## Why is it useful?
- **Instant Health Check**: Know immediately if your campaigns are running and if messages are flowing.
- **Quick Navigation**: Jump straight to the most important actions (like sending a broadcast or checking orders) without searching through the menu.
- **Performance monitoring**: The "Message Velocity" chart helps you spot spikes in traffic or unexpected drops that might indicate technical issues.
- **Financial Awareness**: (Indirectly) By tracking message volume, you stay aware of your usage scale.
