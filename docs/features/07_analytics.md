# Analytics & Insights

## What is it?
**Analytics** provides real-time data on how your business is performing on WhatsApp. It visualizes key metrics like message delivery rates, read receipts, and costs, helping you understand what's working and what isn't.

## Why is it useful?
- **ROI Tracking**: See exactly how much you are spending on conversations versus the engagement you get.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify which templates get read and which get ignored.
- **Fail-Safe**: Instantly spot if messages are failing to deliver so you can fix the issue.
- **Team Efficiency**: (Future) Track how fast your agents are replying.

## Option Buttons (UI Guide)
- **Time Filter**: Dropdown to select "Last 24 Hours", "Last 7 Days", "This Month", etc.
- **Expense Card**: Shows total money spent on conversations in the selected period.
- **Message Stats**:
  - **Sent**: Total messages pushed.
  - **Delivered**: Successfully reached phone.
  - **Read**: Blue ticks.
  - **Failed**: Number blocked or invalid.
- **Events Chart**: Line graph showing trends over time (e.g., spike in traffic on Friday).

## Use Cases
1.  **Marketing Audit**: You sent a campaign to 1,000 people. Analytics shows only 200 opened it. You decide to change the image for the next one.
2.  **Budget Control**: You see you spent $500 this week. You decide to pause some low-performing automations to save money.
3.  **Health Check**: valid contact numbers are causing a high "Failed" rate. You export the failed list and clean your database.
